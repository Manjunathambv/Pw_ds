    "## Theory questions\n",
    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?  \n",
    "    - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. \n",
    "    Great for beginners due to its readable syntax. Web development (e.g., Django, Flask) Data science and machine learning   (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) Automation and scripting Game development, desktop apps, and even IoT\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python? \n",
    "    - Because it does not require compilation into machine code before execution. Instead, the interpreter translates code on the fly, line by line, during runtime.\n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
    "    - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. You cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers, because they are part of Python’s syntax. \n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
    "    - No\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
    "    - Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object’s value can be changed after it is created.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
    "    - Lists are used when you need a dynamic collection that can grow, shrink, or change. You can add, remove, or modify elements\n",
    "    - Tuples are used when you want to ensure the data doesn't change. This is important for things like coordinates, database keys, or function parameters that shouldn't be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python \n",
    "    - == -> Checks if two variables have the same value.\n",
    "    - is -> Checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
    "    - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional (Boolean) expressions. They return True or False based on the logic of the conditions. There 3 main logical operator i.e and , or, not\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    "    - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another. There are two types of type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting \n",
    "    - Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Casting):\n",
    "        Implicit casting is done automatically by Python when you assign a value of one type to a variable of another type\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Explicit Type Casting (Manual Casting):\n",
    "        Explicit casting is when you manually convert a variable from one data type to another using Python's built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
    "    - Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your program. They allow your program to execute different code based on whether a certain condition is true or false\n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "    - The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially, and execute the corresponding block of code for the first condition that is True. It is used when you have more than two conditions to check, and you want to check them in a specific order. If the first condition fails, Python will check the next one in line, and so on, until it finds one that is True.\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops? \n",
    "    - Both for and while loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code in Python. However, they have different use cases and behavior:\n",
    "    - A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, tuple, or range) or an iterable object.\n",
    "    - A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
    "    The loop will continue to execute until the condition becomes false.\n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop. \n",
    "    - Scenario: User Login Attempt\n",
    "        The user has multiple attempts to enter the  correct password, but the program doesn't know how many attempts the user will need.In this case, a while loop is more suitable than a for loop because: The number of attempts the user will make is unknown. The loop should continue as long as the password is incorrect. The loop needs to terminate as soon as the correct password is entered or after a set number of attempts.\n",
