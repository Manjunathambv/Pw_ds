    "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
    "    - Process: Code is translated entirely into machine code by a compiler before it's run.\n",
    "    - Process: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",
    "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
    "    - Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution without crashing the program. It allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
    "    - The finally block in Python is used in exception handling to define cleanup actions that must be executed no matter what—whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "4. What is logging in Python ?\n",
    "    - Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen when your program runs. It's especially useful for debugging, monitoring, and diagnosing problems without interrupting the program's flow (unlike print()).\n",
    "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
    "    - The __del__ method in Python is called a destructor. It is a special method that is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected).\n",
    "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python ?\n",
    "    - Both import and from ... import are used to bring in external modules or specific parts of a module, but they differ in how and what they import.\n",
    "        - Imports the entire module — you access its contents with the module name as a prefix.\n",
    "        - Imports specific objects (functions, classes, variables) from a module directly into your namespace.\n",
    "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python ?\n",
    "    - In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping exceptions in a single block. This gives you flexibility in responding to different types of errors.\n",
    "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
    "    - The with statement in Python is used to simplify file handling by automatically managing resources, like opening and closing files.\n",
    "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
    "    - oth multithreading and multiprocessing are used for concurrent execution, but they differ in how they handle tasks and what resources they use.\n",
    "        - Runs multiple threads within the same process\n",
    "        - Runs multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program ?\n",
    "    - Using the logging module in Python provides a structured, powerful, and flexible way to record information about your program's execution. Here are the key benefits:\n",
    "        - Tracks Program Execution\n",
    "        - Easier Debugging\n",
    "        - Severity Levels\n",
    "        - Can Be Saved to Files\n",
    "        - Works Across Modules\n",
    "        - Highly Configurable\n",
    "        - Safe for Production\n",
    "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "    - Memory management in Python refers to the process by which Python allocates, manages, and frees memory used by your program during execution. It ensures that your program uses memory efficiently without leaks or crashes.\n",
    "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ?\n",
    "    - Exception handling in Python helps you gracefully handle errors without crashing your program. The typical steps are:\n",
    "        - Write Risky Code Inside a try Block\n",
    "        - Catch Exceptions Using except Block(s)\n",
    "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
    "    - Memory management is crucial because it ensures that your Python programs run efficiently, reliably, and without crashing.\n",
    "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
    "    - try Block\n",
    "        - Purpose: Contains the code that might raise an exception (an error).\n",
    "        - Python monitors this code for exceptions.\n",
    "    - except Block\n",
    "        - Purpose: Defines how to handle specific exceptions if they occur inside the preceding try block.\n",
    "        - When an exception happens in the try block, Python jumps to the matching except block to handle it.\n",
    "        - Prevents the program from crashing and allows graceful recovery or messaging.\n",
    "        - If everything runs smoothly, the code inside try executes normally.\n",
    "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
    "    - Python’s garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer needed, so your program doesn’t run out of memory.\n",
    "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
    "    - The else block in a try-except structure is optional and is used to run code only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
    "17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
    "    - Debug, info, critical, error, warning\n",
    "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python ?\n",
    "    - A low-level system call available on Unix/Linux systems that creates a new child process by duplicating the current process.\n",
    "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n",
    "    - When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources (like file descriptors) to manage it.\n",
    "    - If you don’t close the file, these resources stay allocated, potentially causing your program or system to run out of resources.\n",
    "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n",
    "    - file.read()\n",
    "        - What it does: Reads the entire content of the file (or a specified number of bytes if you pass an argument).\n",
    "        - Returns: A string containing all the data read.\n",
    "    - file.readline():\n",
    "        - What it does: Reads one line from the file each time it is called. Returns: A string containing the next line, including the - newline character (\\n) at the end.\n",
    "21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
    "    - The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that happen when some software runs. It helps you record information about your program's execution, which can be useful for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.\n",
    "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",
    "    - The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, and it’s very useful for file handling and manipulation beyond just reading and writing files.\n",
    "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python \n",
    "    - 1. Handling Circular References\n",
    "    - Memory Fragmentation\n",
    "    - 3. Large Object Handling\n",
    "    - 4. Unpredictable Garbage Collection Timing\n",
    "    - 5. Limited Control over Memory Allocation\n",
    "    - 6. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "    - 7. Memory Leaks from C Extensions\n",
    "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
    "    - To raise an exception manually in Python, you use the raise statement followed by an exception instance or exception class.\n",
    "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "    - Improves Responsiveness\n",
    "    - Performs Concurrent I/O Operations\n",
    "    - Better Resource Utilization\n",
    "    - Simplifies Program Design"
