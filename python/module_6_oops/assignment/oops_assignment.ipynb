    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
    "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (in the form of fields or attributes) and code (in the form of methods or functions).\n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
    "    - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have.\n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
    "    - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a real-world entity created from a class. It represents a specific instance of the class and contains data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object or system.\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is the technique of binding data and methods that work on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.\n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
    "    - Dunder methods in Python — short for \"double underscore\" methods — are special methods that have double underscores before and after their names (like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.).\n",
    "    - They allow you to customize how your objects behave with built-in Python operations (like printing, adding, comparing, or converting to string).\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
    "    - Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) from another class (called a parent class or superclass).\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
    "    - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class through a shared interface, while each object can behave differently when a common method is called.\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
    "    - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to the internal data (attributes) and providing controlled access through methods (like getters and setters). This helps protect the integrity of an object's state.\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
    "    - In Python, a constructor is a special method called __init__ that is automatically invoked when a new object of a class is created. It’s used to initialize the object's attributes (i.e., set up its initial state).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
    "    - In Python, class methods and static methods are two special types of methods that behave differently from regular instance methods. They are used when you need to operate on the class itself rather than on individual instances.\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
    "    - ethod overloading generally means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different type or number of arguments) within the same class. \n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
    "    - Method overriding is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
    "    - The @property decorator in Python is a built-in way to define methods that behave like attributes — it lets you access a method like it’s a regular attribute, without needing to call it with par\n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
    "    - Polymorphism is super important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it lets you write flexible, reusable, and scalable code. Here’s why it matters:\n",
    "        1. Code Generalization and Reusability\n",
    "        2. Extensibility\n",
    "        3. Simplifies Code Maintenance\n",
    "        4. Supports Dynamic Method Binding\n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
    "    - abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It often defines abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. Abstract classes are used to provide a common interface and base functionality while enforcing certain methods to be overridden.\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
    "    - Modularity\n",
    "    - Reusability\n",
    "    - Scalability and Maintainability\n",
    "    - Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Abstraction\n",
    "    - Polymorphism\n",
    "    -  Improved Productivity\n",
    "    - Real-world Modeling\n",
    "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
    "    - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
    "    -  Class Variable\n",
    "        - A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Inside the class but outside any methods. Stores data that is common to all objects of the class. Can be accessed using the class name or an instance.\n",
    "    - Instance Variable\n",
    "        - Definition: A variable that is unique to each instance (object) of the class.\n",
    "        - Where it's defined: Inside methods, usually in __init__ using self.\n",
    "        - Purpose: Stores data specific to each object.\n",
    "        - Access: Accessed via the instance only.\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n",
    "    - Both __str__ and __repr__ are special (\"dunder\") methods in Python used to provide string representations of objects, but they serve slightly different purposes.\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n",
    "    - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) inside a subclass. It helps you access and extend inherited behavior without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
    "    - The __del__ method in Python is known as a destructor. It is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected).\n",
    "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
    "    -  @staticmethod\n",
    "        - Does not take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
    "        behaves like a regular function inside a class — no access to instance (self) or class (cls) data.\n",
    "        Used for utility functions that don’t modify or access instance or class state. Can be called via the class or an instance.\n",
    "    - @classmethod\n",
    "        - Takes cls (the class itself) as the first parameter instead of self.\n",
    "        Can access and modify class state that applies across all instances.\n",
    "        Used when you want to work with the class itself, not a particular instance. Often used for factory methods or alternative constructors.\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
    "    - Polymorphism in Python, especially with inheritance, means that different classes can define methods with the same name, and when you call that method on an object, the correct version (the one belonging to the object's class) is automatically used.\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
    "    - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple method calls are linked together in a single expression, one after another, using the dot (.) operator. Each method returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on the same - object seamlessly.\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "    - The __call__ method in Python is a special (“dunder”) method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function."
